# Python-Photo-Name-Converter
Changes the name of the media to the date it was taken. Works with images and video.

The only dependency is Python3. I haven't checked other versions of Python, but getting around and making a version that suits you shouldn't be a big problem for a smart fella like you.
I hope this works well, it does for me.

This changes the name to the date of the creation of each file. Modifications of the files will not interfere with the name given by the code unless it is a new file.

## Instructions

1) Download the '.py' file from this repo.
2) Place the '.py' file at the same directory (same folder) of the media.
3) Execute the '.py' file.
4) Follow the instructions given by the program.
