# Python-Photo-Name-Converter
Changes the name to the date of the creation of each file. Modifications of the file will not interfere with the name given by the code. Works with [images and video](#files-supported).

The only dependency is Python3. I haven't checked other versions of Python, but getting around and making a version that suits you shouldn't be a big problem for a smart fella like you.
I hope this works well, it does for me.

## Files Supported

*  .jpg
*  .jpeg
*  .png
*  .raw
*  .arw
*  .mp4
*  .mts


## Instructions

1) Download the '.py' file from this repo.
2) Place the '.py' file at the same directory (same folder) as the media.
3) Execute the '.py' file.
