# Python-Photo-Name-Converter
Changes the name of the media to the date it was taken. Works with images and video.

The only dependency is Python3. I haven't checked other versions of Python, but getting around and making a version that suits you shouldn't be a big problem for a smart fella like you.
I hope this works well, it does for me.
